Build a complete end-to-end project titled:

“Geospatial Clustering & Business Location Recommendation System”

Use the following full project description and implement everything in Python in Replit:

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Develop a system that collects, cleans, visualizes, and clusters geospatial POI (shops, hospitals, schools, banks, etc.) to find the best location for a new business. The system must compute demand, competition, accessibility, and infrastructure scores to recommend ideal locations.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1. Data Collection

Implement a Python module that can fetch location data from OpenStreetMap using OSMnx / Overpass API.
Fetch POIs such as:

Shops

Restaurants

Schools

Banks

Hospitals

Competitors (define category dynamically)

Store them in CSV and GeoJSON format.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Create a module that:

Removes duplicates

Fixes missing or invalid coordinates

Normalizes category labels

Converts CSV → GeoDataFrame

Adds optional fields (rating, population, footfall if available)

3. Geospatial Visualization

Implement visualization using:

Folium

Marker Clustering

Heatmaps

Choropleth maps

Generate maps such as:

All POIs map

Cluster map

Heatmap of density

Competition heatmap

Save HTML maps to a /maps folder.

4. Clustering (Machine Learning)

Implement clustering algorithms:

DBSCAN with haversine metric

K-Means for comparison

HDBSCAN (if installable)

Steps:

Convert lat/lon to numpy array

Cluster using DBSCAN

Mark cluster labels

Detect hotspots & sparse regions

5. KDE Heatmaps

Implement Kernel Density Estimation maps:

Population density (if supplied)

POI density

Competition vs demand gap

Output as interactive Folium heatmaps.

6. Suitability Analysis / Location Scoring Model

Implement scoring model with parameters:

Final Score =
    w1 * demand_score +
    w2 * low_competition_score +
    w3 * accessibility_score +
    w4 * infrastructure_score


Weight defaults:

demand = 0.4

competition = 0.3

accessibility = 0.2

infrastructure = 0.1

Compute:

Competition Score → inverse cluster density

Demand Score → based on population + supporting POIs

Accessibility Score → roads, transport, centrality

Infrastructure Score → hospitals, banks, schools nearby

Return a ranked CSV of top 10 best locations.

7. Output Modules

Generate:

A. CSV outputs

cleaned_pois.csv

clusters.csv

location_scores.csv

B. HTML Map Outputs

all_pois_map.html

cluster_map.html

heatmap.html

best_locations_map.html

C. Console Report

Print analysis:

number of POIs

number of clusters

sparse zones

recommended business zones

8. Optional Dashboard

If possible, create a simple Streamlit dashboard with:

Map view

Cluster selection

Filters (business category, radius)

Top recommended locations

9. Project Structure

Generate the following folder structure:

/project
    /data
        raw_data.csv
        cleaned_data.csv
        clusters.csv
        scores.csv
    /maps
        all_pois_map.html
        cluster_map.html
        heatmap.html
        recommendations_map.html
    /modules
        fetch_data.py
        clean_data.py
        visualize.py
        clustering.py
        scoring.py
    main.py
    README.md

10. README.md Specification

Include:

Full project explanation

How to run the project

Algorithms used

Screenshots placeholders

Future improvements section

11. Deliverables

Your final output should include:

✔ Complete working Python code
✔ Fully generated folder structure
✔ All modules imported in main.py
✔ Maps saved as HTML
✔ CSV outputs saved in /data/
✔ A clean README.md describing everything
✔ Comments + documentation inside code

12. City Input System

Allow user to input:

City name

Business type

Radius (meters/km)

Example:

Enter city: Bangalore
Enter business type: coffee_shop
Enter search radius (km): 5

13. Ensure the Replit project runs completely

Everything must run using:

pip install osmnx geopandas folium scikit-learn pandas numpy shapely


Now generate the entire Replit project with

Full code

Full folder structure

Full README

All modules
